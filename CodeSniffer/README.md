Rejected sniffs:

  - '''Generic.Commenting.DocComment''': code is its own comment,
    so a doc block to only provide a @var type is acceptable

Future sniffs in master, but not included in last stable release 3.2.3:

  - '''Generic.WhiteSpace.ArbitraryParenthesesSpacing'''
  - '''Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing'''
  - '''Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent'''
